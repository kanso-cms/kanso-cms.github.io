--------------------------------------------------------

Kanso's comes with built in SPAM protection for both the framework and the CMS. The CMS uses Kanso's SPAM service to moderate post comments but you can you also use it directly for your own needs.

> Spam management is part of the Framework group of services.

--------------------------------------------------------

### Access

You can access the SpamProtector directly via the IoC container:
```php
$spam = $kanso->SpamProtector;
```

--------------------------------------------------------

### Configuration

The SPAM service can be configured in the `app/configurations/spam.php` file.

--------------------------------------------------------

### Usage

The `isSPAM` method returns `TRUE` if text is SPAM or `FALSE` if not:
```php
if ($spam->isSpam('foooofdscz'))
{
    # That text is spam
}
```

The `rating` method returns a spam rating on text (<= 0 is SPAM anything else is not):

```php
if ($spam->rating('foooofdscz') <= 0)
{
    # That text is spam
}
```

The `isIpWhiteListed` method returns `TRUE` if an IP address is whitelisted or `FALSE` if not:
```php
if ($spam->isIpWhiteListed('192.168.1.1'))
{
    # IP is ok
}
```

The `isIpBlacklisted` method returns `TRUE` if an IP address is blacklisted or `FALSE` if not:
```php
if ($spam->isIpBlacklisted('192.168.1.1'))
{
    # IP blacklisted
}
```

The `blacklistIpAddress` method adds an IP address to the blacklist:
```php
$spam->blacklistIpAddress('192.168.1.1');
```

The `unBlacklistIpAddress` method removes an IP address from the blacklist:
```php
$spam->unBlacklistIpAddress('192.168.1.1');
```

The `whitelistIpAddress` method adds an IP address to the whitelist:
```php
$spam->whitelistIpAddress('192.168.1.1');
```

The `unWhitelistIpAddress` method removes an ip from the whitelist:

```php
$spam->unWhitelistIpAddress('192.168.1.1');
```
--------------------------------------------------------

### Point System

The SPAM service uses a point system to determine if a piece of text is considered spam. The `SpamProtector` runs through a validation process, for everything in a comment that it likes, the comment gets a point. For everything it doesn't like, it looses a point (or two, or three). At the end of the process, If the comment has a score of `1` or higher, it's considered valid. If it gets a `0`, it should be moderated manually. If it's below `0`, it's considered spam.

The spam system uses the following rules:

| Condition                                                                                            | Action               | Points                  |
