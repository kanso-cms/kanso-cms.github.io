### Welcome
Welcome to the Kanso CMS documentation. Here you will find everything you need to start building your next Kanso project.

Kanso is a modular OOP based PHP CMS and/or framework which is highly customizable and easy to use.

The CMS is decoupled from the framework so you can use only the framework if you like. The CMS is built ontop of the application core as a group of services.

Kanso comes with everything you will need to build your next application and makes building complex PHP projects a breeze.

### How To Read This Documentation
If you are new to Kanso, I recommend you read this documentation from start to finish. If you are already familiar with Kanso, you can instead jump straight to the appropriate section.

This documentation begins by explaining Kanso's concepts and architecture before venturing into specific topics like request and response handling, routing, and templating.

### Get Started
To get started using Kanso, please see the [Installation](/getting-started/installation) section.
